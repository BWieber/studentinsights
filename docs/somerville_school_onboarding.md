## Onboarding A Somerville School To Student Insights

### Human-Focused Steps

_These are based on the [user personas](https://github.com/studentinsights/studentinsights#user-personas-who-were-serving) we are serving. The primary focus at this stage is Principals._

+ [ ] Meet with the principal:
  + [ ] Give overview of Student Insights:
    1. [ ] [Project goals](https://github.com/studentinsights/studentinsights#student-insights)
    1. [ ] [User personas](https://github.com/studentinsights/studentinsights#user-personas-who-were-serving)
    1. [ ] [Product features](https://github.com/studentinsights/studentinsights#product-overview-how-were-helping)
    1. [ ] [Development priorities](https://github.com/studentinsights/studentinsights#project-priorities)
  + [ ] Show principal what the school overview page / STAR graphs for her/his school look like
  + [ ] Ask principal what kind of data queries s/he asks for or produces most often
  + [ ] Ask principal what data processes need improvement within her/his school
+ [ ] Observe a MTSS / SST meeting to get a baseline understanding of how these meetings are run
+ [ ] Schedule follow-up meeting with whichever member of the school staff takes the most active role in MTSS / SST; discuss how to use Student Insights for note-taking and service recording during those meetings


+ _Others?_

### Data-Focused Steps

+ [ ] Have the principal review the educators assigned to the school in Aspen/X2
  + [ ] If there are educators whose status is not up-to-date (i.e. Inactive educators assigned as Active), the school secretary should correct those entries in Aspen/X2
  + [ ] If educators are missing LASIDs (district IDs) in Aspen/X2, notify John Breslin who can add the missing LASIDs from the HR system
+ [ ] Ask the principal if there are any known data issues that might affect the data imported into Student Insights from Aspen X2 or STAR
+ [ ] Ask the school secretary if there are any known data issues that might affect the data imported into Student Insights from Aspen X2 or STAR
+ _Others?_
